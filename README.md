###Full Stack Netflix Clone
This personal Project (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. 
I built the following pages with the help of Karl Hadwens Tutorial Page: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. 
Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.
